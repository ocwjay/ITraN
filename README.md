# ITraN
The navigation bar to end all navigation bars.

ITraN stands for Ice Tray Navigation. It's pretty much just a navbar that emulates an icecube tray, and is extremely similar to the app drawer of a mobile smart phone. ITraN is designed to be plug and play, so all you have to do is read the documentation, add the code to your project, and you're ready to navigate with ITraN. <br />
As a side note, it's pronounced ih-tren. <br />

# More Docs Coming soon!
More documentation will be added as the code becomes completed.
